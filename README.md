#BLitz3d

This compiler is a fork of the Blitz3D NG project, which itself was a fork of the original Blitz3D by the late Mark Sibly.
My goal is to modernize Blitz3D and make it compile on Linux, Windows, Mac and Android. Android compilation is really important to me. The other platforms I see more as a dress rehearsal.
Blitz3D will have object-oriented syntax and use GCC as its compiler. You'll be able to easily download ready-to-use versions for Linux and Windows.
Over time I'd like to introduce an alternative C-like syntax (for those who, like me, prefer it).
Yes, I know — reviving a compiler from 2000 with goto and gosub might seem a bit old-fashioned. But I think now that AI is learning to write code, this compiler could actually become a better solution than all those engines where you have to learn complex environments, study strategies and whatnot.
Anyway, even if nobody else ends up caring about this, I can tell you that working on this project just makes me feel good.
