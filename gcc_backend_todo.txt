GCC Backend TODO List
=====================
Created: 2025-12-07

COMPLETED:
----------
[x] Basic compilation (variables, functions, loops, conditions)
[x] 3D Graphics (BirdDemo, Castle, Dragon work)
[x] Color/Light functions - fixed float/int type mismatch
[x] Input$ real-time display - added bbFlip calls
[x] Text/Print cursor positioning - Text now updates curs_y
[x] Joystick functions (JoyX, JoyY, JoyZ, JoyXDir, JoyYDir, JoyDown, JoyHit)
[x] Terrain functions (TerrainSize)
[x] Mesh functions (FitMesh, CreateMirror)
[x] Input function declaration
[x] startPrinting/bbLocate use current buffer (gx_canvas)

HIGH PRIORITY - OOP Implementation:
-----------------------------------
[x] MethodCallNode - method calls (obj\Method()) - FIXED 2025-12-07
[x] SuperMethodCallNode - Super\Method() calls - FIXED 2025-12-07
[x] ClassDeclNode - class declarations (Class/End Class) - already working
[x] NewNode - object creation (New ClassName()) - already working
[x] Field access for class instances - already working
[x] Inheritance (Extends keyword) - already working
[x] Self keyword - already working
[x] Super keyword for parent method calls - FIXED 2025-12-07

MEDIUM PRIORITY - Missing Runtime Declarations:
-----------------------------------------------
[ ] Test more demos to find missing function declarations
[ ] Each new demo typically reveals 2-3 missing declarations
[ ] Pattern: grep for "warning" during compilation to find them
[ ] Add declarations to codegen_c.cpp header section

MEDIUM PRIORITY - Types/Collections:
------------------------------------
[x] For Each iteration over custom types - WORKING
[x] First(TypeName), Last(TypeName) - WORKING
[x] Insert Before/After - WORKING
[x] Delete object - WORKING

LOW PRIORITY - Additional Features:
-----------------------------------
[x] Audio 3D (EmitSound, listener positioning) - WORKING
[x] Networking (socket functions) - WORKING (UDP, TCP server/client, DNS)
[x] Array edge cases (multidimensional) - WORKING (2D, 3D, float, string, objects)
[x] String conversion edge cases - WORKING (Str$, Int, Float, Left$/Right$/Mid$, Upper$/Lower$, Trim$, Chr$/Asc, Hex$, Instr, Replace$)

TESTING STATUS:
---------------
Working demos (GCC backend):
- BirdDemo - OK
- Castle - OK
- Dragon - OK (after adding FitMesh, CreateMirror)
- XFighter - compiles, needs joystick to test fully

Not working:
- (OOP samples now working!)

Working OOP:
- test_super.bb - OK
- test_inheritance.bb - OK
- test_multi_inheritance.bb - OK

NOTES:
------
- Frontend/BackCanvas are same pointer in OpenGL SDL (single surface)
- Type mismatch was root cause of green tint bug (color params need float)
- codegen_c.cpp has hardcoded extern declarations - add new ones there
- Look at codegen_llvm for reference when implementing OOP

ESTIMATED COMPLETION:
--------------------
- Current state: ~98-99% functional
- All major features working!
- Remaining: Test more demos to find edge cases
